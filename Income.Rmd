#### Simple linear regression equation for the relationship between income and age:
Let Y represent the income and X represent the age.
The simple linear regression equation for this relationship is:  
Y = β0 + β1*x + ε  
where Y is the predicted income, β0 is the intercept, β1 is the coefficient for age, X is the age, and ε represents the error term.

#### Simple linear regression equation for the relationship between income and experience:
Let Y represent the income and X represent the experience.
The simple linear regression equation for this relationship is:  
Y = β0 + β1*x + ε  
where Y is the predicted income, β0 is the intercept, β1 is the coefficient for experience, X is the experience, and ε represents the error term.

```{r}
incomedata=read.csv('multiple_linear_regression_dataset.csv', header=TRUE)
attach(incomedata)

# Relationship between income and age
lm_age <- lm(income ~ age, incomedata)

# Relationship between income and years of experience
lm_experience <- lm(income ~ experience, incomedata)

# Print the regression results
summary(lm_age)
summary(lm_experience)

```

# 3
```{r}
# Extract the coefficients (β1)
beta1 <- coef(lm_experience)["experience"]

# Mean of experience
mean_experience <- mean(experience)

# SSReg
SSReg <- beta1^2 * sum((experience - mean_experience)^2)

# SSTot
SSTot <- sum((income - mean(income))^2)

# The correlation coefficient (r)
r = sqrt(SSReg / SSTot)

r
```


# 4
```{r}
# Extract the coefficients (β1)
beta1 <- coef(lm_age)["age"]

# Mean of age
mean_age <- mean(age)

# SSReg
SSReg <- beta1^2 * sum((age - mean_age)^2)

# SSTot
SSTot <- sum((income - mean(income))^2)

# The correlation coefficient (r)
r = sqrt(SSReg / SSTot)

r
```

The regression coefficient  (β1=447.9) is only meaningful to show the positive relationship between age and income; and as age increases, the income also tends to increase. However,  this positive relationship is moderately correlated (r=0.53), indicating that it may not fully explain the variations in income and other factors likely influence income as well.

# 6
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)

# age vs. income
ggplot(incomedata, aes(x = age, y = income)) + 
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Income", x = "Age", y = "Income")

# experience vs. income
ggplot(incomedata, aes(x = experience, y = income)) + 
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Experience vs. Income", x = "Experience", y = "Income")

# age vs. experience
ggplot(incomedata, aes(x = age, y = experience)) + 
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red") + 
  labs(title = "Age vs. Experience", x = "Age", y = "Experience")

```


Through the scatter plots, we can found that age, experience and income are all correlated.  
Age and income are moderately correlated(r=0.532)  
Experience and income are strongly correlated(r=0.984)  
Age and experience are moderately correlated(r=0.615)    
So the best model is multiple linear regression.  Multiple linear regression models can use both age and experience as predictors, which is conducive to more accurately representing the relationship between these variables.
